## How It's Made:

## Tech used: ![HTML5 BADGE](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=HTML5&color=23555f&style=plastic&logo=html5)![CSS BADGE](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=CSS3&color=285f65&style=plastic&logo=css3)![JAVASCRIPT BADGE](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript)

Static site.  Focused on keeping a consistent theme and an easy UX for the user to get any information they may need

## Optimizations
I would like to add more to the arcade and restaurant sections.  Would also like to add league sign ups as well as open bowling reservations.

## Lessons Learned:

Learned a lot about manipulating photos with this project.  Keeping sizing consistent is key to avoiding unwanted stretching.
